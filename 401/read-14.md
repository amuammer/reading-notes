# RBAC

### What is RBAC?
RBAC is nothing more than the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization.


### Benefits of RBAC?
With the proper implementation of RBAC, the assignment of access rights becomes systematic and repeatable. Further, it is much easier to audit user rights, and to correct any issues identified.


#### RBAC vs. ABAC vs. ACL
There are some alternatives for/variations of RBAC, including:

- **Access control lists (ACL)** — An ACL is a means of defining access rights by a given user or user group
`an ACL could be used to allow users from one department to make changes to a document, while only allowing users from other departments to read the document.`

- **Attribute-based access control (ABAC)**, sometimes known as policy-based access control, can use a variety of attributes, including `user department, time of day, location of access, type of access required`, etc. to determine whether a user’s access request should be granted.

 **RBAC arguably offers a more simplified and manageable approach, given that the privileges of a user in a given position are granted with a simple effort, to all others in the same role.  These methods can, however, be used in tandem to increase control.**
