# Engineering Topics - Notes

### How to Solve Programming Problems

a simple set of steps to follow which you can use for any algorithm type programming problem.

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.

`Note` **As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.**

### Common mistakes

`You really want to make sure you take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it.`

`Another big mistake is trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration.  Keep it simple, don’t try to get fancy.`

### Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive


**Imagine that an hour of your time is worth $1,000.**

1. `What would your life look like?`

2. `What people would you stop putting up with?`

3. `What problems would you stop wasting time on?`

4. `What things would you stop — and start — doing?`

5. `Your results would be incredible. You’d become exponentially more productive, focused, and effective.`
