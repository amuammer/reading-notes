# What is Heroku?

Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) provider that companies and developers use for deploying and hosting applications in the cloud. Heroku handles all the infrastructure for you, allowing you to focus on your app. As a developer, you can deploy from Git, and you simply do a push to their respective server, and the appropriate frameworks are installed or updated in the cloud. You can do remote commands for database migrations and other tasks. Heroku is a scalable, meaning based on the number of users on your service or difficulty of each request you can adjust “Dyno’s.” Dynos are lightweight Linux containers that run a single user-specified command. One dyno is plenty to run many kinds of apps. Brochures sites, simple APIs, and blogs are a few of the many possible uses for this free dyno.


### Heroku Accommodates Many Development Languages

 Now it supports Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure, Python, PHP, and Go. This means a variety of developers can look to Heroku for an inexpensive way to scale their application, no matter their preferred development language

### Choose from a Wide Range of Heroku Add-ons

 While using the PaaS, developers have option to choose from a wide range of add-ons, buttons, and buildpacks from the Heroku Elements Marketplace. Some of these elements are free, whereas others are paid. But the add-ons help developers to extend and customize Heroku according to precise needs of individual apps. Based on his requirements, a developer has option to avail several add-ons related to caching, monitoring, logging, data stores, content management, testing, email/SMS, user management, document/image/video processing, and security. He can further simplify custom application development and management by choosing downloading useful development tools from the Heroku Elements Marketplace.


### Memory Use in Heroku

Sometimes applications based in Heroku can have issues supporting software that requires a lot of memory.

Large enterprise applications that use a lot of resources and memory. Heroku offers a free memory pack, but if the application needs even more memory, the product owner will have to budget funds to acquire that memory. And costs to scale memory capacity in Heroku get expensive quickly. To reduce the cost of buying memory, customers should consider optimizing their business applications. A possible route is alter the application so that it uses less memory. Turning on Garbage Collector more often is also an option.
