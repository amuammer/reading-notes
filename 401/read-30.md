# Hashing
 HASHING- the process of taking a value and converting it to some sort of numeric code that represents it.

# Hash Table
 Assume that you have an object and you want to assign a key to it to make searching easy. To store the key/value pair, you can use a simple array like a data structure where keys (integers) can be used directly as an index to store values. However, in cases where the keys are large and cannot be used directly as an index, you should use hashing.

# Creating a Hash
A hashtable traditionally is created from an array. I always like the size 1024. this is important for index placement. After you have created your array of the appropriate size, do some sort of logic to turn that “key” into a numeric number value. Here is a possible suggestion:

1. Add or multiply all the ASCII values together.
2. Multiply it by a prime number such as 599.
3. Use modulo to get the remainder of the result, when
4. divided by the total size of the array.
5. Insert into the array at that index.

```
Key = "Cat"
Value = "Josie"

67 + 97 + 116 = 280

280 * 599 = 69648

69648 % 1024 = 16

Key gets placed in index of 16.
```
