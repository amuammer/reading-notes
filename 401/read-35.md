### Graphs
A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

Here is some common terminology used when working with Graphs:
<br/>
`Vertex` - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
<br/>
`Edge` - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
<br/>
`Neighbor` - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
<br/>
`Degree` - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

### Graphs Vs Trees
In graphs, there are no rules dictating the connection among the nodes. A graph contains a set of nodes and a set of edges but these edges can connect nodes in any possible way. Trees are actually a subset of graphs.

### Undirected Vs Directed
`Directed Graph` → A graph with only directed edges (Like a 1-way street).

`Undirected Graph` → A graph with undirected edges (Like a 2-way street).

### Real World Uses of Graphs

* GPS and Mapping
* Driving Directions
* Social Networks
* Airline Traffic
* Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products
