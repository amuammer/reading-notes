# Javascript Templating
a technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. <br/>
The **template** *is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.* <br>

The **template engine** then *replaces variables and instances declared in a template file with actual values at runtime*, and convert the template into an HTML file sent to the client. <br/>

### Mustache

**Mustache** is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

```javascript
Mustache.render(“Hello, {{name}}”, { name: “Sherlynn” });
// returns: Hello, Sherlynn
```


# Flexbox
The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities. This article gives an outline of the main features of flexbox, which we will be exploring in more detail in the rest of these guides.


### **- display**

This defines a flex container; **inline or block** depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.

```css
.container {
  display: flex; /* or inline-flex */
}
```

### **-flex-direction**
This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container.

```css
.container {
  flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;
}
```
a) **row (default):** left to right in ltr; right to left in rtl <br/>
b) **row-reverse:** right to left in ltr; left to right in rtl <br/>
c) **column:** same as row but top to bottom <br>
d) **column-reverse:** same as row-reverse but bottom to top

### **- justify-content**

This defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size.

```css
.container {
  justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly | start | end | left | right ... + safe | unsafe;
}
```
