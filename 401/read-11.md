# Authentication

### Basic Authentication
In basic HTTP authentication, a request contains a header field in the form of
`Authorization: Basic <credentials>,`
where credentials is the Base64 encoding
of ID and password joined by a single colon :.

### Bcrypt
bcrypt is a password-hashing function designed by Niels Provos and David Mazi√®res, based on the Blowfish cipher and presented at USENIX in 1999. Besides incorporating a **salt** to protect against rainbow table attacks, bcrypt is an adaptive function: over time, the iteration count can be increased to make it slower, so it remains resistant to brute-force search attacks even with increasing computation power.

### JWT
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard  that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

### Authentication Cheat Sheet
**Authentication** is the process of verifying that an individual, entity or website is whom it claims to be. Authentication in the context of web applications is commonly performed by submitting a username or ID and one or more items of private information that only a given user should know.

**Session Management** is a process by which a server maintains the state of an entity interacting with it. This is required for a server to remember how to react to subsequent requests throughout a transaction. Sessions are maintained on the server by a session identifier which can be passed back and forward between the client and server when transmitting and receiving requests. Sessions should be unique per user and computationally very difficult to predict.
