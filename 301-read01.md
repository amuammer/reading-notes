# Responsive web design


## Responsive vs. Adaptive vs. Mobile
**Responsive:** Responsive generally means to react quickly and positively to any change, based on different factors <br/>
 **Adaptive:** means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation, such as change, based on preset factors. <br/>

 **Mobile:** build a separate website commonly on a new domain solely for mobile users. <br>

***Responsive and Adaptive web design are closely related, and often transposed as one in the same.A combination of the two is ideal, providing the perfect formula for functional websites***


## Responsive web design components:
Responsive web design is broken down into three main components, including <br/>
**flexible layouts** <br/>
**media queries** <br/>
**flexible media** <br/>

**flexible layouts**, is the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width. Flexible grids are built using relative length units, most commonly percentages or em units.

**relative length unit 	what does it represent**
- vw 	Viewports width
- vh 	Viewports height
- vmin 	Minimum of the viewport’s height and width
- vmax 	Maximum of the viewport’s height and width


**media queries** <br/>
Media queries provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances.

```html
<!-- Separate CSS File -->
<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" media="all and (max-width: 1024px)">
```

**flexible media**
The final, equally important aspect to responsive web design involves flexible media. As viewports begin to change size media doesn’t always follow suit. Images, videos, and other media types need to be scalable, changing their size as the size of the viewport changes.

```css
img, video, canvas {
  max-width: 100%;
}
```
