# CSS Layouts

## Layouts
* `<div>` elements are often used as containing elements to group together.
* Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
* The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts.
* Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
* CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
* You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
