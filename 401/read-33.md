# React Context
Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

## Context Provider
Every Context object comes with a Provider React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes.

## Context Consumer
A React component that subscribes to context changes. This lets you subscribe to a context within a function component.
