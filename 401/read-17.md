## What is TCP

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation through which application programs can exchange data. TCP works with the Internet Protocol (IP),

## TCP vs UDP
TCP and UDP have many differences and similarities. They are the most commonly used protocols for sending packets over the internet. They both work on the transport layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack and both use the IP protocol.

### Connection and connectionless
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol and UDP is a connection-less protocol. TCP establishes a connection between a sender and receiver before data can be sent. UDP does not establish a connection before sending data.

### Reliability
TCP is reliable. Data sent using a TCP protocol is guaranteed to be delivered to the receiver. If data is lost in transit it will recover the data and resend it. TCP will also check packets for errors and track packets so that data is not lost or corrupted.
